## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

One of the tasks that I now feel more comfortable with is the @media inquiries. 

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 376px)
```
This lesson helped me make sense of how to optimize the screen for appropriate devices.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 376px){
    .card {
        min-width: 343px;
        height: 625px;
        display: block;
        margin-top: 27px;
        margin-left: 10px;
        margin-right: 10px;
        margin-bottom: 100px;
        transform: translateY(2%);
    }
```
